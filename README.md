this will be my redme file explaining my thoughts about the project 

ook then this repo has 2 parts 
1 just this a simple webpage 
2 node + express server (localhost:3000)
// !! keep in mind that json file and node modules are specific yo my system 

// and the commands that need to be run in the terminal again are :- 

1. npm init -y
2. npm install express ejs nodemon 
3. node app.js 

and the server should be on port 3000 //
